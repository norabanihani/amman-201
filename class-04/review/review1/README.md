 A Guessing Game about me
It's something like a game gives the user yes/no questions about me, and returns an alert to tell him if the answer is true or false.

Then Question 6 and 7 are like questions that need specific answers and user have to try limited times.
for question 6 you have 4 attempts to hit the correct answer.
for question 7 you have 6 attempts to hit the correct answer but there are more than one correct answer.
